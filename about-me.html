<div class="text">
  <p>I was born in Chicago, Ill. and my forebearers mostly stemmed from islands - Sicicly, Ireland and England. Both of my parents are from upstate New York but wanted out as soon as possible and went west until finally picking Irvine as home.  I went to school at UC Santa Santa and I currently live in Anaheim Hills, CA.  I like spending my time coding and traveling with my girlfriend to various parts of the world.  Check out some pics.</p>
