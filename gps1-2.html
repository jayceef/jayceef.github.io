      <p id="title">Pear Programming is better than Orange Programming</p>
    </div>

    <div class="content">Pair programming is an attempt by two people to work together on the same code,
    whether locally or remotely.
    </div>

    <div class="content">Dev Boot Camp likes pair programming for many reasons. Pair programming is more efficient than
      writing code by yourself, because it gives the pair opportunities to collaborate on ideas and check each
      others' work. For example, pair programming combines the knowledge of both people, therefore expanding the
      possibilities of writing decent or correct code, as well as better design in general. There's also the learning-
      teaching paradigm, whereby one partner who might know more about one thing and help out, then vice versa.
