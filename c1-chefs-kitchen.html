Menu?  No Thanks.

The Dev Bootcamp experience takes the school/student relationship to another level.  Students come to Dev Bootcamp knowing that they are expected to take ownership of their time there.  If there is a problem that they are experiencing they are expected to initiate any corrective measures that need to take place.  This is not a place for "I need help, please fix this problem."
If you need help, you need to take the bull by the horns and take control of your problem.  It could mean simply raising your hand, or asking a cohort.  Or it could meaning burning the midnight oil and staying for a couple of extra hours after class to have a better understanding of the problem.

This could cause students a little trepidation at first.  This isn't normally how a school is structured.  But once they get their feet wet they should have confidence in their ability to take the steps necessary to solve problems from their own initiation.

This type of learning is quite exhilarating and makes me a little nervous.  But I'm all in!
