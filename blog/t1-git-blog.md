As programmers, we create code.   Just as important, we need to change the code that we created.  We need to keep track of these changes.  Why?  Imagine you've got super-duper awesome code.  Then you edit that code.  And after the edit your program now sucks.

That's where version control comes in.  We Use Git to keep track of changes to our code so we don't have to.  Everytime we make changes to our code Git will record those changes.  Perfect, right?

Well, how are others suppose to make changes to your code?  You need Github for that.  Whereas Git is local program that is stored on your computer, Github is stored on servers so other hackers like yourself can have access to your code.  With your permission of course.  You upload your files on GitHub so others can edit them and vice versa.  Awesome.
